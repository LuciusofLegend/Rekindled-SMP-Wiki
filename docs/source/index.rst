* Middle-click or double-click on an empty slot in a chest or your inventory to sort it.
* You can put any item on your head.  Any item.  They can also be equiped using dispensers!  Because why not?

World Generation
-----------------

There are a lot of worldgen mods on the server, and none of them add particularly important features (not to downplay their quality), so I'll just give a breif list of them:

* Explorations (fun little vanilla-themed structures)
* Repurposed Structures (vanilla structures rethemed for new locations with new loot tables)
* Terra (completely revamps vanilla biomes and adds many excelent new ones)

Other
------

Miscelanious tweaks and features.

Worldborder
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This worldborder is not a vanilla one.  It's added by a mod called Chunky Border.  The border is circular, and 10000 blocks wide.
It is visualized by blue particles when you get close.  If you move outside the worldborder you will be teleported back outside immediately.

There is a:

* 10k border in the Overworld
* 1250 border in the Nether
* 900 border in the End

No Chat Reporting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Chat messages are not signed, and therefore you cannot use the chat reporting feature.  If you have a problem with what someone is saying in chat, contact the server owner.

Mods Command
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This mod adds several commands which let you find out which mods are installed on the server.

* /mods page <page_number> | Displays a page view of the mods list
